The analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1. **The Artist with the Most Songs**: Identifying the artist with the most songs among the top 100 most streamed songs.

2. **Collaborations in Songs**: Determining the number of songs with 1, 2, and 3 artists among the top 100 most streamed songs.

3. **Common Release Year**: Finding the most common release year among the top 100 most streamed songs.

4. **Top 10 Most Streamed Songs**: Listing the top 10 most streamed songs along with their details.

5. **Common Release Month**: Identifying the most common release month among the top 100 songs and visualizing it using both bar and line graphs.

6. **Energy Level Analysis**: Analyzing the energy levels of songs across the top 100 list using a scatter plot.

7. **Speechiness Level Analysis**: Analyzing the speechiness levels of songs across the top 100 list using a scatter plot.

8. **Reoccuring Key**: Finding the most recurring key among the top 100 songs and visualizing it using a bar graph.

9. **Danceability Analysis**: Analyzing the danceability levels of songs across the top 100 list using a scatter plot.

10. **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring the correlation between streaming statistics (streams) and various song characteristics such as energy, danceability, speechiness, BPM, acousticness, and valence.

## Data Analysis

The analysis is conducted using Python and various libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. Several data exploration and visualization techniques are used to answer the questions and gain insights from the dataset.

### 5. Common Release Month

- November and October are the most common release months among the top 100 songs. These months seem to be popular for releasing songs that gain high streaming numbers. The line graph shows the distribution of track releases by month.

### 6. Energy Level Analysis

- There isn't a strong correlation between energy levels and ranking in the top 100 songs. Songs with varying energy levels can be found throughout the list.

### 7. Speechiness Level Analysis

- Similar to energy levels, speechiness levels don't exhibit a strong correlation with ranking in the top 100. There is a mix of speechiness levels among the popular songs.

### 8. Reoccuring Key

- The key of songs in the top 100 list varies, with no single key dominating. However, the analysis shows that c# is more common than others.

### 9. Danceability Analysis

- Danceability levels also do not show a strong correlation with ranking. Songs with different danceability scores can be found in the top 100 list.

### 10. Correlation Analysis

- Correlation analysis reveals that there is a moderate negative correlation between the number of streams and energy levels. This suggests that songs with lower energy levels tend to have more streams. Other song characteristics like danceability, speechiness, BPM, acousticness, and valence do not exhibit significant correlations with streaming numbers.

This analysis provides insights into the characteristics of the top 100 most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023. It highlights trends related to artists, collaborations, release years, and song characteristics. These findings can be valuable for music enthusiasts and data analysts interested in understanding the factors that contribute to a song's popularity on Spotify.
